# Virtual-tutor
A virtual tutor to teach you how to play the piano. Built entirely using openCV. The virtual piano is an interface that allows users to simulate a musical instrument by printing a template on a sheet of paper. The user then ’plays’ the virtual instrument as if it were a real one. The user records this with a video camera, feeds the video to the application, and appropriate music is generated by the application. This is achieved by calibration of the template, detecting the position of fingers, identifying the hit position and playing notes corresponding to that position.


# Previous work & Challenges


Suteparuk[3] leverages the change in activity maps caused by the depression of actual piano keys to detect keypresses. The problem with this approach is that in the case of a virtual piano, we have no key depression to leverage to detect keypresses. This scenario is much harder to detect as touches to the paper could be for a few microseconds and hence our system needs to work in real time.   Rastogi and Joshi explored the idea of virtual musical instruments for multiple instruments with intriguing results[1]. They use a marker and detect the position of the marker tip to achieve a keypress. The problem with that is that a. We are restricted to the number of markers one person can hold to play b. The learning of playing this virtual instrument does not contribute to the case where one plays an actual piano. One idea that is explored in this paper is playing the instrument using fingers instead of using a specialized marker. Our work focuses on improving the constraints of this system by allowing users to play virtual piano without any form of specialized markers, with their bare hands.
